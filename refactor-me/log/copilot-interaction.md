# Copilot Interaction Log

## Refactor AwkwardGreeter to Idiomatic Haskell and Reader Monad

**User:** The `refactor-me` directory contains a small CLI application `awkward-greeter` that prints greetings and phrases in a chosen language. The code needs be refactored to make it more idiomatic Haskell. The program's behaviour should remain unchanged, and a test suite to ensure this should be added.

**Copilot:** Read the task description and source code. Refactored the code to remove the global variable, pass `Language` as an argument, and added comments. Created a test suite and exported necessary functions for testing.

**User:** The code does not compile when running `stack`. This is due to the change to use the fields, it requires `NamedFieldPuns`. Please revert these lines to using `..` because `RecordWildcards` is already activated.

**Copilot:** Reverted to using `RecordWildcards` for field extraction. Re-tested build and test.

**User:** Please commit the changes to a new branch. push the branch to github, and open a pull request for the issue

**Copilot:** Created branch `refactor-awkward-greeter`, committed, pushed, and opened a pull request.

**User:** Can the code be refactored to use the Reader monad?

**Copilot:** Refactored the code to use the Reader monad for passing `Language` context. Updated dependencies and fixed YAML structure. Noted that the test suite needs to be updated for the new API.

**User:** Please update the test suite according to the change to `Reader`

**Copilot:** Updated the test suite to use `ReaderT` for `mkPhrases`. Tests now match the new API.
