The executable in this Haskell package is a CLI program that prints a
simple conversation to stdout. It has an option to use one of
different languages.

At the moment, a global variable is used to hold the chosen language.
Suggest how to refactor this program to be more idiomatic Haskell,
removing the global variable. Insert line-end comments into the
changed code lines to explain the refactoring.

Make sure the refactored program compiles and has the same observable
behaviour as the original. Do this by adding a small test suite.
